readbulk
========

**readbulk** is an `R` package that facilitates loading multiple data files with a similar structure and combining them into a single `data.frame`, using the `read_bulk` function. It wraps most common `R` functions for reading data, retaining the flexiblity of the available tools.

For (experimental) psychologists, the package provides the `read_opensesame` function which wraps the above, providing the appropriate defaults for loading the many files created by [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/).

General Information
