# readbulk

[![cran version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/readbulk)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readbulk)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/51659562.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/51659562)


**readbulk** is an `R` package that facilitates loading multiple data files with a similar structure and combining them into a single `data.frame`, using the `read_bulk` function. It wraps most common `R` functions for reading data, retaining the flexiblity of the available tools.

For (experimental) psychologists, the package provides the `read_opensesame` function which wraps the above, providing the appropriate defaults for loading the many files created by [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/).


## General Information

The `readbulk` package was developed by Pascal Kieslich, with contributions by Felix Henninger. It is published under the GNU General Public License (version 3).


## Installation

The current stable version is available on CRAN and can be installed via `install.packages("readbulk")`.
